Cobbler with dnsmasq managed

To start, use
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 53:53 -v /home/cloud/conf:/conf --name cobbler dolpher/cobbler

I'm using priviledge mode to start the container:
docker run -ti --net host --privileged -v=/my/conf:/conf --name cobbler dolpher/cobbler

Note that any files in /conf will be copied to /etc/cobbler, so you can pass config files to cobbler

To access:
http://host_ip/cobbler_web
with username and password cobbler

The dnsmasq is not started untill you did the first cobbler sync
